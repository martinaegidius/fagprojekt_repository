****************
The user manual states on page 1 that we ship two
versions of EasyPlot: one 32-bit version (epw32.exe)
for Windows 95 and NT users, and one 16-bit version
(epw.exe) for Windows 3.1x users.

The latter version epw.exe is not included in this
release of EasyPlot version 4. Users of Windows 3.1x
will need to install the Win32s disks supplied before
they can use EasyPlot. Win32s is a utility supplied by
Microsoft which emulates the 32-bit environment, so
that you can use any program designed for Windows 95.
The latest version which EasyPlot supports is version
1.30c.
